Community shared agriculture (CSA) is a subscription model for small- and medium-scale farms. It allows farmers to raise funds at the beginning of the season by selling shares to customers. Shareholders receive periodic distributions of product when it is harvested.

The app we will be releasing in Spring 2017 aims to serve both farmers and customers in this arrangement.
