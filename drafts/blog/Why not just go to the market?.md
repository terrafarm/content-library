This model is meant to change the timing of the farmer’s cash flow. By having money early in the season, farmers have a better chance of improving their harvest. The good-faith of many people paying in advance provides an important boost to the farmers investment ability.

Selling can be time consuming. This system aims to reduce waste and risk by coordinating sales ahead of time. 

One worry is over-buying and waste on the consumption end. To reduce this problem, we make trading and donating possible. If a buyer gets bored or over stocked with a product, they can seek variety by trading individual vouchers. Charitable donations are also an option.

Some farms will have distribution pick-up days. Some will accept vouchers at a market booth. Some may deliver. And sometimes third-party delivery services will be available.
