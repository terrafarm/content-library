Community shared agriculture (CSA) is a subscription model for small- and medium-scale farms. It allows farmers to raise funds at the beginning of the season by selling shares to customers. Shareholders receive periodic distributions of product when it is harvested.

Some people also use the "S" to mean supported, sponsored, or subscription, as in "community sponsored agriculture". In any case, the core concept is the same: pay-in-advance for a scheduled product and get distributions when it is harvested.

Some people may want to donate a couple hours of their time to help out with manual work. Others might be able to offer resources like a tractor or seeds. You reserve a share and message the farmer about your work trade offer.
